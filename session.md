- ✓ Added comprehensive error handling and user experience improvements
- ✓ Enhanced authentication checks and username detection
- ✓ Improved git configuration verification

**Issues Resolved**:
- SSH/HTTPS friction in repository setup
- Authentication verification before GitHub operations
- Git configuration validation
- Branch naming consistency (master→main)
